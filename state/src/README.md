In its most basic form, the editor state is made up of a current <a
href="#state.EditorState.doc">document</a> and a <a
href="#state.EditorState.selection">selection</a>. Because there are a
lot of extra pieces that an editor might need to keep in its state
(such as an [undo history](#history) or [syntax
tree](#language.syntaxTree)), it is possible for extensions to add
additional [fields](#state.StateField) to the state object.

@SelectionRange

@EditorSelection

@CharCategory

### Changes and Transactions

CodeMirror treats changes to the document as
[objects](#state.ChangeSet), which are usually part of a
[transaction](#state.Transaction).

This is how you'd make a change to a document (replacing “world” with
“editor”) and create a new state with the updated document:

```javascript
let state = EditorState.create({doc: "hello world"})
let transaction = state.update({changes: {from: 6, to: 11, insert: "editor"}})
console.log(transaction.state.doc.toString()) // "hello editor"
```
